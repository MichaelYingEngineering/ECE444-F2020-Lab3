-Briefly summarize the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases

SQL databases are based on the relational data model.
Tables are linked with other tables to form useful relationships between them. This is done by tables having columns referencing the primary key of rows of other tables (or the same table).
Duplication of data is avoided, but tables need to be joined to present relational data.

NoSQL databases do not follow the relational data model. NoSQL uses collections instead of tables and documents instead of records. There is no join operation.
Data is duplicated but the number of tables is reduced and querying speed is increased.
